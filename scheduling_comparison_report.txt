- Space-Shared Makespan: 320.1
- Makespan Difference: 0.006000000000028649
- Better Makespan: Time-Shared

- Time-Shared Average Execution Time: 301.32733333333334
- Space-Shared Average Execution Time: 40.0
- Average Execution Time Difference: 261.32733333333334
- Better Average Execution Time: Space-Shared

CONCLUSION:
Based on the simulation results, the Time-Shared VM scheduling strategy performs better for overall completion time (makespan).

The Space-Shared strategy performs better for average cloudlet execution time.

RECOMMENDATION:
Choose scheduling strategy based on priority:
- Use Time-Shared if average execution time is more important.
- Use Space-Shared if overall completion time (makespan) is more important.
